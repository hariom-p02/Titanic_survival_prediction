Titanic_Survival_Prediction (🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning) This project aims to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features.

🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning pipeline that:

Preprocesses the Titanic dataset
Handles missing values
Encodes categorical variables
Normalizes numerical features
Trains and evaluates a classification model
Achieves strong performance on survival prediction
Provides a reproducible, well-documented solution
📁 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle:
🔗 Kaggle Titanic Dataset

It consists of information about Titanic passengers including:

PassengerId
Name
Age
Sex
Ticket
Fare
Cabin
Pclass (Passenger class)
SibSp (No. of siblings/spouses aboard)
Parch (No. of parents/children aboard)
Embarked (Port of embarkation)
Survived (Target variable: 1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)
🧼 Data Preprocessing

🔍 1. Missing Value Handling

Age: Filled with median
Embarked: Filled with mode
Cabin: Dropped due to high % of missing data
🔁 2. Dropped Columns

PassengerId, Ticket, Name, Cabin
🔠 3. Encoding Categorical Variables

Sex and Embarked encoded using LabelEncoder
📊 4. Feature Scaling

Features scaled using StandardScaler to normalize distributions
🧠 Model Building

We chose a Random Forest Classifier due to its:

Robustness to overfitting
Ability to handle both numerical and categorical data
Built-in feature importance evaluation
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
📈 Model Evaluation
The model performed exceptionally well on the test set:

🧠 Note: While a perfect score is impressive, be cautious—it might indicate:

A very easy split of the dataset,

Potential data leakage, or

A small test set that doesn't generalize well.
